      "FOR SINGLE DATA YEARS: Birth rates are calculated based on the resident population of the data year involved.  For census years, April 1 census counts are used (e.g. 2010).  For postcensal years, July 1 estimates from the postcensal Vintage that matches the data year are used (e.g. July 1, 2011 resident population estimates from Vintage 2011 are used as the denominator for  2011rates).  For intercensal years, intercensal population estimates are used in rate calculations (e.g. 1991-1999, 2001-2009).  Race-specific population estimates for 1991 and later use bridged-race categories.\r\n",
